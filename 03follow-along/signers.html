        <h2>Famous Signers</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Thomas Jefferson </dt>
            <dd>Jefferson was born April 13, 1743, on his fathers plantation of Shadwell located along the Rivanna
                River near the Blue Ridge Mountains of colonial Virginia.1 His father Peter Jefferson was a successful
                planter and surveyor, and his mother, Jane Randolph, was a member of one of Virginias most
                distinguished families. When Jefferson was fourteen, his father died, and he inherited a sizeable estate
                of approximately 5,000 acres. That inheritance included the house at Shadwell, but Jefferson dreamed of
                living on a mountain.</dd>
            <dt>John Adams</dt>
            <dd>Before becoming President in 1797, John Adams built his reputation as a blunt-speaking man of
                independent mind. A fervent patriot and brilliant intellectual, Adams served as a delegate from
                Massachusetts to the Continental Congress between 1774 and 1777, as a diplomat in Europe from 1778 to
                1788, and as vice president during the Washington administration.</dd>
